Facebook Mutual Friends
=======================

####Description
Log in with Facebook, select one of your friends, and visualize the connections between all of the friends you share. Uses [arborjs](http://arborjs.org) visualization library.

####Behind the Scenes
I couldnâ€™t find an existing app that visualizes my friends the way I wanted, so I decided to take a crack at it. I got some good experience with the Facebook JavaScript SDK and Graph API.
